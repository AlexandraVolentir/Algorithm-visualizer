# Angular-Data-Strucures
It is a logical interpreter for simple algorithms - which contain a while loop, an if statement, etc., which helps the user better understand the thought of the consecutive iterations in their code. From any sch file with values, the code draws blocks (which are movable and have a specific shape) and correspond to the action which is given them to do. The code also converts the image which the user has drawn (representing algorithms) to cpp code.
